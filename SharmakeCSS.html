        Hello Everyone! Welcome to my CSS webpage. I'm going to give a little bit information about Data science
        including the skills you need in order to be a data scientist, work community as well as some of the rules
        you're expected to follow at the workPlace.
      </p>

      <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Data Science.</h2>

      First, I will define the meaning of the term Data science. Data science is the field of applying advanced
      analytics techniques and scientific principles to extract valuable information from data for business
      decision-making, strategic planning and other uses. In other words, the job of Data Scientist is to analyze and
      write sift down mega sized data into more reasonable and understandable information for the company or business to
      make a more precise decision.
      <!--Mark's comment 8/15: This text needs to be within a tag.-->

          <!--Mark's comment 8/15: Don't use b and i tags. Use strong and em instead because, as of 20 years ago or so, tags are meant to define what's on a page, not specify how they are styled.-->
